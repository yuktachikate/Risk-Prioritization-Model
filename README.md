# Risk-Prioritization-Model
This project helps utilities decide which grid assets to repair when budgets are limited using a transparent, risk-based methodology. It computes risk (Probability of Failure Ã— Consequence of Failure), optimizes selections under a budget, and produces outputs for Power BI and ArcGIS.
